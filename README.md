 ## College Timetable
 

#### Problem Statement



In college, life is hectic and super busy; you have to do a lot of things, such as assignments, tests, club meetings, learning, playing, and so on. Your laptop or mobile app is also flooded with data from all of these different things, and without a good data management and storage method, it becomes extremely messy and difficult to find things. Academics would be the most affected, as you obtain multiple books from various sources and store them in various locations on your computer. It's possible that you'll wind up spending hours on the computer looking for the book or syllabus.

So we used our newly acquired skills in GDSC classes to create an app to solve this problem!!

#### Proposed Solution



So the Solution we have come up with is ORARIO!!, It's an app which includes your timetable, your all subject syllabus, Links of various clubs insta/fb IDs and Discord

#### Functionality & Concepts used 


The app was created in Android Studio with Kotlin as the primary programming language, and some of the features used are listed below:

Created App Icon & Splash Screen : We created a new icon to replace the app's default icon. We alsoÂ designed the app slash screen in a simple, beautiful, and modern design and implemented it smoothly.

Simple Easy Design with Linear Layout: The app was designed in a simple, to-the-point style that is easy to grasp for everyone. For all of its pages, the app uses a linear layout by default, with Scroll View in some areas as needed.

Interactable Things: There are numerous CardViews throughout the programme, the most of them are clickable. Some of the textViews have been linked to open another link when clicked.

Navigation & Livedata: In Fun Time, we included navigation to assist users relax after being overwhelmed by the syllabus, so we used navigation fragments to include jokes, games, and YouTube videos to lighten their mood, as well as attempting to integrate livedata into the login process.
